    <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
    <li>1 jar (24 oz) marinara sauce</li>
    <li>15 oz ricotta cheese</li>
    <li>1 egg, lightly beaten</li>
    <li>2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
    <li>1/2 cup grated parmesan cheese</li>
    <li>1 tsp dried oregano</li>
    <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Steps: </h2>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Prepare the Sauce:</strong> In a large pan, brown the ground beef with garlic. Stir in the marinara sauce and oregano, then simmer for 10 minutes.</li>
    <li><strong>Make the Cheese Mix:</strong> In a small bowl, combine the ricotta cheese with the beaten egg and half of the parmesan cheese.</li>
    <li><strong>Layer the Dish:</strong> Spread a thin layer of meat sauce in a baking dish. Place 3 noodles on top, followed by a layer of the ricotta mixture and mozzarella.</li>
    <li><strong>Repeat:</strong> Continue layering sauce, noodles, and cheeses until all ingredients are used, finishing with a thick layer of mozzarella on top.</li>
    <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Cover with foil and bake at 190°C (375°F) for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for another 20 minutes until the cheese is golden and bubbly.</li>
    <li><strong>Rest:</strong> Let the lasagna rest for 15 minutes before serving so the layers stay together when sliced.</li>
