  <h2>Ingredients: </h2>
  <ul>
    <li>1 pre-made pizza dough (or homemade dough)</li>
    <li>1/2 cup classic pizza sauce</li>
    <li>2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
    <li>1/2 cup sliced pepperoni</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon dried basil</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
    <li>Cornmeal (for the baking sheet)</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Steps: </h2>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Preheat the Oven:</strong> Set your oven to 245°C (475°F) and let it get very hot. If you have a pizza stone, place it inside while the oven heats.</li>
    <li><strong>Prepare the Dough:</strong> On a lightly floured surface, stretch or roll out your dough into a 12-inch circle.</li>
    <li><strong>Prepare the Pan:</strong> Sprinkle a little cornmeal on your baking sheet or pizza peel to prevent sticking. Place the dough on top.</li>
    <li><strong>Add the Toppings:</strong> Brush the edges of the dough with olive oil. Spread the pizza sauce evenly, leaving room for the crust. Sprinkle the mozzarella cheese and then arrange the pepperoni slices on top.</li>
    <li><strong>Season:</strong> Sprinkle the dried basil and garlic powder over the entire pizza for extra aroma.</li>
    <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Place in the oven and bake for 10-15 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is bubbly and slightly browned.</li>
    <li><strong>Slice and Enjoy:</strong> Remove from the oven and let it cool for 5 minutes before slicing.</li>
  </ol>
