    <li>1 jar (24 oz) marinara sauce</li>

    <li>1 tsp dried oregano</li>
    <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
  </ul>

    <li><strong>Make the Cheese Mix:</strong> In a small bowl, combine the ricotta cheese with the beaten egg and half of the parmesan cheese.</li>
    <li><strong>Layer the Dish:</strong> Spread a thin layer of meat sauce in a baking dish. Place 3 noodles on top, followed by a layer of the ricotta mixture and mozzarella.</li>

    <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Cover with foil and bake at 190°C (375°F) for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for another 20 minutes until the cheese is golden and bubbly.</li>
    <li><strong>Rest:</strong> Let the lasagna rest for 15 minutes before serving so the layers stay together when sliced.</li>
