# Odin Recipes

## Description
This is my first project from **The Odin Project** curriculum. The main goal of this project is to build a basic recipe website using only **HTML**. 

Throughout this project, I am practicing how to structure web pages and manage my code using **Git** and **GitHub** on my Linux (Xubuntu) environment.

## Skills Demonstrated
* **HTML Fundamentals**: Using headings, paragraphs, lists, and images.
* **Directory Structure**: Organizing files and folders within a project.
* **Version Control**: Managing a professional workflow with Git (add, commit, push).
* **Technical Documentation**: Writing clear project descriptions in English.

## Future Goals
This project marks the beginning of my journey to become a **Full-Stack Developer**. My next steps include learning **CSS** to style these recipes and eventually pursuing a degree in **Computer Engineering**.
